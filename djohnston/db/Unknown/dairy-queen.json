Sink in (sinking?) the sands of Dairy Queen
C                                                   G
Charmed by the earth s delight she suffered
G                                      E
Now she s awake and in a dream
C                                                     G
Lays down her head and pulls up the covers
C                                      G                 D
Was she just waiting for a song that didn t last
C                                          G            D
Was she just looking for the future in the past

Or the memory of love

Walking around she recollects
Reflection in the mirror, she saw her mother
Weird aura when the poor boy
Asked her if she would like some water
Thinking the damn young man was ugly from the lust
Worrying the horoscope of time she couldn t trust
And the memory of love

Looking for trouble I think you ve found
Laughter can be an awful sound
Some people never really learn
They don t know how to turn their love light on
 No news is good news, they told you in the hell
No shoes like your shoes, they blamed you for the goose
For the memory of love

The rabbit ate the chocolate rabbit
The children came to play at the funeral
Abraham Lincoln once walked five miles
To return a nickel to a whore
All things must be bad and good, it s written in the stars
Jesus built his own cross so we could get along
With the memory of love

G       C  (repeat)
Feeling good now!
Feeling good now!
