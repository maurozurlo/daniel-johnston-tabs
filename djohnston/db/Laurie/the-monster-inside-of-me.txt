You see the monster in my eye

If you could only help me girl

The monster inside of me

The monster inside of me

Maybe if someone had said to Vincent Van Gogh
"Keep punching, Joe!"
Maybe he'd be here today.
Maybe he'd be here today.

You inspire the strength within

And I can be conquerer

As my spirit rise above us

And we could be happy
And we could be happy
And we could be happy
