Hate Song
from Songs of Pain

Am          C        G           C
You wont even know who you are or what youre doing
   Am         C      G
Just you and your shadow on the wall
Am          C  G      C
You wont even get nothing for Christmas
Am       C         G
No one will take you to the mall
Youll be alone

        F
Youll be waiting by the phone
      C
Waiting for my call
         G          C
Youll sit nervously waiting for it to ring
        F               C
Youll be waiting by the phone hoping it will ring
         G
But it wont ring
Cause I wont call

(chords: Am C G C Am C G)
Youll bite into your fingernails
And spit them on the floor
You wont have no fingernails no more
Youll think about the good times that we used to have
While staring at the cobwebs on your door
And youll be all alone

(chords: F C  G  C  F C G)
The clock will tick and itll make you sick
As every moment of your life passes by
Youll contemplate suicide with a knife one night
And it wont be nice
Youll be all alone

(chords: F C  G  C  F C G)
Yes, no one will be there to stop you
No one to clear your head
No one to talk you out of it
No one to hear the last words that you said
No one will shed a tear
No one will be there to find you dead
Cause youll be all alone
