Pothead
Oh, how I love this song 

For the B7/D# chord try   X-6-4-4-4-5  or just use B7
Sliding up to this D7 sounds nice X-0-7-7-7-8

Man you look like old man s eyes
When I saw you in that room
And now you re on tour
They booked you in the asylum

You work so hard at being a buffoon
And now you ain t got no incentive left
You popped your own balloon

Chorus:
                      C           G
You wanted to be somebody
              F       C
But you ain t nobody
B7                       C
You ain t got no body
                       G
You re just a head
                           C          G
You re just a pothead


Bridge (lead in notes g-f#-e:  3-2-0 on the first string)
   A                                                        A7
I heard one day they said you got so high
   D                                                            D7
You ate up a chicken head and it was still alive
  A                                                                      A7
I have some friends who swear you did so don t deny
  D
Some day you re gonna get so messed up
You ll eat the head off your kid
                                               A
And won t you be sorry, pothead 

(verse chords)
You brag to all your friends
About the fun you had last night
I wonder if you realize you forgot to brush your teeth

And then you ll come a-bummin 
Asking for some money
You even tried to roll the sacred pages
And you burnt your lip

That lip is has a trench in it
Where that wild weed sits
Sucking like a parasite
Of any sense you might have left

You say that you are happy
And you like stormy weather
Well I think that you re just dumb
And you don t know any better

You play your rock and roll guitar
You say you re gonna be a big star
But everyone in this neighborhood
Knows just who you are

Gm                             Dm          
No I ain t tryin  to be hard
           C                   F
I don t mean to be cruel
              Em                                       Am
I m just tryin  to say something that ll shock 
                             C           Bm   
You into going back  to school
        B/D#               C
Or maybe at least reality
         G
In this year
C

B7                       C

You re just a head
