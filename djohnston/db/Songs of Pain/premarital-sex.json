Premarital Sex

I'm working on a full guitar tab with all the goofy keyboard licks... I'll post it when it's done


For Dm/A try X-0-2-2-3-1  (Dylan s  Ballad of a Thin Man  chord)

Cm
First you say you will

Then you say you won t

Then you say you re waiting for that special someone 
                          Am   Dm/A   Am (repeat 4 times)
You will have some day

Cm
It s guilty temptation

Adolescent lust
                                                           Am   Dm/A   Am (repeat 4 times)
Now you ve got more than pimples popping out

F                                  G
First you say that you will
But you know you won t
             F                       G
But you gotta get your thrill
Don t look at me
             F                     G
Go ahead and take the pill
                    Cm (back to verse)
Premarital sex


At the place that I work
The guys are always talking
About sexual delights
And pleasures of the flesh
You can get it plenty
You can get it nice
You can get it anywhere at anytime
If you pay the price

First you say that you will
But you know you won t
But you gotta get your thrill
Don t look at me
Go ahead and take the pill
