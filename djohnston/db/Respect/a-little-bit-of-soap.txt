A Little Bit Of Soap
(by Bert  Berns)

This song is in the key of B on the recording, but I'm guessing that he played it in C, and that there was a tape speed problem somewhere along the way.

The C7 chord after the word soap is really just a single note Bb, but the full chord works just fine too (or A if youre playing the version in B)
                
        C  C7
A little bit of soap
   F          G
Will wash away your lipstick
     C 
On my face
             C7
But a little bit of soap
   F D7    G
Will never, never erase
         C
The pain in my heart
     C7
And my eyes
   F
As I go through the lonely years
        C
A little bit of soap
       G       C
Will never wash away my tears


         C  C7
A little bit of soap
   F         G
Will wash away your powder 
     C
from my chin
            C7
But a little bit of soap
   F D7     G
Will never, never begin
            C     C7
To take away the hurt that I feel
   F
As I go through the lonely year
        C
A little bit of soap
       G         C
Will never wash away my tears


       C
Have you heard
            F
When love begins to die
             G G7
It leaves someone to cry
      C
Night and day

Like a bird
             F
You left the robin's nest
             G
And just like all the rest
       C
You flew away


            C7
A little bit of soap
   F        G
Will take away your perfume
     C
Eventually
          C7
A little bit of soap
   F D7           G
Will never wash away the memory
     C       C7
Of your name in the night
     F
That Ill call through the lonely years
        C
A little bit of soap
       G       C
Will never wash away my tears
