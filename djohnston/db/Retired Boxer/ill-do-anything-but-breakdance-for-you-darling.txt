Sometimes I feel like I am a boxer

                       G          C                      D
Seems like I'm always standing in the ring

And then I find someone's been in my locker

                    G             C                 D   
He left me a note that says I can't sing

          G                  C                            G            G/C
I'll do anything but break dance for you, darlin'

I don't know what happened and I can't remember

G            C              G         G/C
But I was soon to discover

             G       C             D
That my radio had been broken

          G                  C                             G          G/C

All the folks on dope in search of hope

Everybody and the lonely orphan

And everyone around the world

Every boy and every girl

For all the good times

Always remember and never forget

In my secret heart

I'll do anything but break dance for ya, darlin'
