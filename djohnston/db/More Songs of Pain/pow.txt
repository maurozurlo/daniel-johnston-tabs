Pow:

           Dm                 C                F Bb F
It's an odd and awful way to be
           Dm                C                F Bb F
it's a happy laughter of the free
            C                   F
it's a truth and it's a dare
            C                  F
it's a feeling in the air
            Dm             C             F Bb F
it's a mother's love for a child
