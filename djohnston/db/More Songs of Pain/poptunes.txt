Sometimes he plays an Ab minor chord instead of Ab major. I hear Ab minor on the first two verses and Ab major on the last two.

 Eb               Bb7

      Eb
Monkey middle with a fiddle
     Bb7
And a real tight ragtime band
       Eb
Calls and plays of fame and fortune
       Bb7
Heard so loud across the land
        Cm      Ab(m)
And those little people buy those records
   Eb        Bb7
Sit lonely in their homes
   
With funny faces falling into the great unknown

They got little polka-dot undies
And you know they have their fun
They got matching ties and curtains
And they get their washing done
But come evening comes that feeling
When they lay their burden down
When they put that record on

The house is jumping with excitement
Everyones acting out of character
But everything goes back to normal
A half an hour later
And everyone acts like nothing happened
As that record goes back in the sleeve
Thats one house guest thatll never leave

Monkey middle with a fiddle
And a real tight ragtime band
Calls and plays of fame and fortune
Heard so loud across the land
And those little people buy those records
Sit lonely in their homes
With funny faces falling into the great unknown
