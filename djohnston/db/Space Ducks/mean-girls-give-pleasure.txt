Lyrics
Every time I think and I do get by
And I have all my friends and I do get high
But every time I can't deny
I'm already dead and I already died
You think that its soup and that its your friend
But its already gone and poop in the end
There's nowhere to go and no way to win
Then you start to fantasize again

Mean girls give pleasure
Its my greatest treasure
Mean girls give pleasure
Its my greatest treasure

You can't really live and you can't really send
And all of your dreams are probably pretend
And nothing makes sense and its over again
And you're already dead and you're dying for sin
Too blind to see and too weak to think
And the angel of death has taken you for a walk
Nothing to say but just small talk
And your head is in a block

Mean girls give pleasure
Its my greatest treasure
Mean girls give pleasure
Its my greatest treasure

You can't really love and you can't really hate
And all of your problems are probably fake
And she tastes just like ice cream and cake
Then you know its not too late
The more that you live the less you know for
And love could wash up on the shore
And it drives you to tears after all of these years
And being rich is better than being poor

Mean girls give pleasure
Its my greatest treasure
Mean girls give pleasure
Its my greatest treasure
