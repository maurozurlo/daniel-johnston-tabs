This is the beginning. The treble part goes up one octave along the way somewhere in there. I really like this song too  been kind of looking at it. Im kind of a beginner at the piano hope you can kind of get where im going with it. This takes you up to the chorus. Please forgive the punctuation marks as a sad attempt at measurements and articulations.
