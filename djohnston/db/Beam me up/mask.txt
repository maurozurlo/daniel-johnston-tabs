seems like her broken heart,the loving part, was missing
as the drama unfolds she's lost the art of loving
nowhere is where she goes to find her piece of nothing
seems like she's had enough but she's always up to something

and now as the story goes another day is dying
she's already changed her clothes and in disgrace she's laughing

it wasn't so long ago she had me so temptated
and with no obligation I was feeling so sedated
now I'm left pretty dumb and every bit retarded
now the fires that burn are more than what she started

and now as the story goes another day is dying
she's already changed her clothes and in disgrace she's laughing

it's just a show of shows is that all she's thinking
and maybe I told her so, I'm thankful that I'm living
another day in the past and every hour I'm haunting
everybody is wearing a mask playing skip to the lou my darling

and now as the story goes another day is dying
she's already changed her clothes and in disgrace she's laughing away

no one knows the sorrow of a broken heart that's bleeding
seems as though she never cares for no one that's despairing
more or less love and somehow she was lying
time after time she gave it all away without trying
just to take you for a ride like a bird that's falling
no one knows the sorrow of a broken heart that's bleeding
seems as though she never cares for no one that's despairing
like rain upon an open grave
