Thank you for the response. I don't play piano, but I was wondering if you could transcribe the chords so I could play it on guitar? It seems like it would be an easy one to play on guitar.Some Things Last A Long Time

I tried to maintain the simplicity of the piano part for this tab. Playing with fingers instead of a pick may make this easier.
