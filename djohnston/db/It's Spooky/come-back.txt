Come Back
from It's Spooky

The guitar on Come Back is tuned down roughly a whole step (D-G-C-F-A-D) and is then played using these chords.

C   X-3-2-0-1-0   (sounds as Bb)
F/A   X-0-3-2-1-1   (sounds as Eb/G)
A   X-0-2-2-X-X  (sounds as G)

These are the chords I put in the tab.  If you dont want to retune you can play it with a capo on the 3rd fret using these chords instead (fret numbers are counted from the capo).  It will sound pretty much the same.

G   3-2-0-0-0-X    (sounds as Bb)
C/E   0-3-2-0-1-0   (sounds as Eb/G)
E   0-2-2-X-X-X  (sounds as G)



Come Back

C
I took a wrong turn of events
                F/A                             C
I made a wrong fork at the situation
               C
I took a wrong turn of events
                 F/A
I made a wrong fork at the situation

C
Ive been talking to you in your absence
                  F/A
And Ive fabricated quite a turn of events
  C
I always knew it would come to this
   F/A
I always knew it would come to this

A
Come back, come back into his hands
His every wish is your command
Come back, come back into Satans arms
I wont shield you from the evil
And I love all your songs

(as before  C   F/A   C   F/A)
Ive been talking to you in my absence
And your narrow path has made sense of it all
I always knew it would come to this
I always knew it would come to this

A
I make up what I believe
I dont believe what you believe
Come back, come back to Austin, Texas
Satan wants you and he loves all your songs

(as before   C    F/A   C   F/A)
You reach through 200 miles of your own music noise
So dear and so quiet
Like bells across water
Like lying in the darkness

A
Come back, come back into his hands
His every wish is your command
Come back, come back into Satans arms
I cant shield you from evil
But I love all your songs

Oh Danny Boy, the old serpents calling
