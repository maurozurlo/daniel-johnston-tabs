If Id Only Known (J. Fair)
from Jad Fair and Daniel Johnston: Its Spooky

same chords as Its Spooky

A  D  (throughout the whole song)

If Id only known I could have said something sooner
But I didnt, so I didnt, now its done
The last thing Id do was the first thing you did
What we once had is all gone

I see it all a little too clear
Too clear for my own good
Let sleeping dogs lie is a good rule Im told
I only wish that they would

If Id only known I could-a said something sooner
I really did think it would last
Now its too late, its over and now
My future is all in my past
