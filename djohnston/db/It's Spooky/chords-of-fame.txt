(Capo 3rd fret)
G    C    G
G
I found him by the stage last night
               C                          G
He was breathing his last breath
A needle full of heroin 
        C                      D
was all that he had left
         G            
I can see that you make music
                    C               D
Cause you carry your guitar
         G
But God help the troubadour
        Em
Who tries to be a star

G                  C            G
So play the chords of love my friends
G                C          G
Play the chords of fame
G                             C
But if you want to keep your songs
G          C          D
Dont, dont, dont
              G           C           G
Dont play the chords of fame

(verse chords)
Ive seen my share of hustlers
As they try to take the world
When they find their melody
Theyre surrounded by the girls
But it all fades so quickly
Like a sunny summer day
Reporters ask you questions
They write down what you say

(chorus chords)
So play the chords of love my friends
Play the chords of fame
But if you want to keep your songs
Dont, dont, dont
Dont play the chords of fame

(verse chords)
Theyll rob you of your innocence
Theyll put you up for sale
The more that you will find success
The more that you will fail
Ive been around, Ive had my share
And I really cant complain
But I wonder who I left behind
The other side of fame

(chorus chords)
So play the chords of love my friends
Play the chords of fame
But if you want to keep your songs
Dont, dont, dont
Dont play the chords of fame

G                                            C
Theyre gonna put me in the movies
G                                                    D
Theyre gonna make a big star out of me
G                                               C
Ill play the part and I wont rehearsing
G                                D               G   C   G   C   G   C  Em
Cause all I gotta do is act naturally


Chords of Fame
Original version by Phil Ochs


E                    
I found him by the stage last night
               D                  A
He was breathing his last breath
E
A bottle of wine and a cigarette
D              A
Was all that he had left
A
I can see you make the music
D                 E
cause you carry a guitar
A
God help the troubadour
       F#m                   G     
Who tries to be a star

      A              G            A
So play the chords of love, my friend
 A            G            A
Play the chords of pain
A                     D              A
If you want to keep your song,
A                   E
Dont, dont, dont
           A             G           A
Dont play the chords of fame
