Daniel occasionally plays A7 and D7 instead of regular A and D

A7
A   D    E7
She invited me to a pity party
Every hour everyone was making fun of me
I told her it really didnt matter
You cant imagine what its done to my personality
C    F    G7
I dont know where she should go, but I lose
Though I tried, like a lullaby, I lose
A    D    E7
Once I saw her in a crazy dream
She was laughing, I looked the other way
Then I find that she unwinds, she puts me down behind my back
Everyone seems to have a love but me, its what I lack
C    F    G7
Ive been denied the hurt inside, I lose
Though she was barely a friend of mine, I lose
I got left out of the in crowd
They speak as if I was there
They say the cruelest things, I seen their type
A bunch of buttwipes that rule
C   F   G7
Dont make sense, its really strange, I lose
Though I try, theres no sense giving up, I lose
I walk the second mile, theres no one there, I lose
I pick up the pieces of my broken dream, I lose
Everyone had their fun, I lose
A   D   E7
Yet she was a one of them from the beginning
How am I to carry on, theres no help given
Then I realize its all reoccurrence
What theyre thinking, their mind is a blur
C    F   G7
I seen the future, and I aint even there, I lose
I see it all, and its really, the same old thing, I lose
They think theyre smart, all huddled together, I lose
One more time, I try to make it, I lose
A7   D7   E7
I lose, I lose
Tell me about it, darlin, now
