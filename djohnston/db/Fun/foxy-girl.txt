She'd open up the door

     G
She's a foxy girl

And she knows just how to please

She brings out the man inside of me

And the stars shine bright
   A7
On a dark Texas night
C           D       G
She brings out the man inside of me
     C
And my mind unwinds
     G
She's so very kind
     C             D
And I swear I'm melting on the floor

G7#9  Bb7#9  C7#9  D7#9
(same chords as first verse)

Her eyes look at you
You don't know what to do
But she seems to understand
Everything you're thinking of
Your words are lost in conversation
Passing from your lips
And all the time you're looking at her
Struggling with your wit

(same chorus chords)
She's a foxy girl
And she's sure to rack your brain
She's a girl who might just drive you sane
And the stars shine bright on a dark Texas night
And she's as sweet as candy cane
And your mind unwinds
She's so very kind 
And you'd swear you're melting on the floor

(verse chords)
She's so precious
She's so luscious
She could make you happy
She could set your soul free
She's the only one you've ever talked to this way
And all of a sudden you may find
That you have something new to say


She's a foxy girl
Don't you know you love her so
It makes you feel like letting go
And the stars shine bright
On a dark Texas night
Don't you know she loves you so
And your mind unwinds

She's so very kind
And you'll sear you're melting on the floor

She's so precious
She's so luscious
