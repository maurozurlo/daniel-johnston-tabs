Sorry Entertainer

This song only uses four strings and requires a good deal of retuning. Comparing to a keyboard or some other instrument makes tuning a bit easier. Use only the four highest strings. 

D string (4th)  tune up to a note between E and F (pretty tight!)
G String (3rd)  tune up to a note between G and G#
B string (2nd)  tune down to a note between G# and A
E string (1st)  tune down to about an A (way down)

I found the 4 individual plucked notes at the beginning and ending of the song really useful for checking the tuning. They should correspond to your four detuned open strings. All the chords are straight bar chords across the 4th, 3rd, and 2nd strings (sometimes he bars across all four...)

I named the cords after the barred fret. 
So, b2 means X-X-2-2-2-X or X-X-2-2-2-2
b3 means X-X-3-3-3-X or X-X-3-3-3-3
etc

"R" means rest - in this case an eighth note rest

I'd be curious to hear if anyone tries this out. This would sound best on a beat up nylon string guitar...

Intro: pluck through open chord (0)
Verse: b0-b0-b2-b0-b3-b0-b4-b5 (keep repeating in eighth notes)

Where the wind blows
That's where I go
Where the moon is
That's where I am
And when I just
Have a problem
Always hoping the wind will blow me away again

Chorus: b4-b4-b0-b0-b3-b3-b0-b0 (6 times)
   b6-b6-b6-b6-b6-b6-b6-b6
   b5-b5-R-b4-R-b3-R-b2

I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainer
I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainer

Drove those demons
Out of my head
With an organ and a pencil full of lead
And when I'm dead
I'd like to have it said
He drove those demons out of his head

I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainer
I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainer

Now the curtain parts the stage
It's the dawn of a new and exciting age
And I'm free
Free at last
Like a monkey out of its cage

I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainer
I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainer
(end with the plucked open chord again)

I just banged it out on the piano - these piano chords replicate the guitar part pretty well.

Try playing a single note melody with the left hand:
Left Hand
Verse: e - e - f# - e - g - e - g#- a 

With the right hand play two-note half-step clusters. "g/g#" means play g and g# together 
Right Hand
Verse: g/g# - g/g# - a/a# - g/g# - a#/b - g/g# - b/c - c/c#

If you play these left and right hand parts together, it sounds pretty cool... 

For the chorus try these left hand and right hand parts together


RH: c/c# - c/c# (rest) - (rest) b/c -  b/c  -  (rest) - (rest)
LH: a  - a  - e  - e - g# -  g#  -   e -   e

(repeat 6 times) then...

RH: c#/d - c#/d - c#/d - c#/d - c#/d - c#/d - c#/d - c#/d 
LH a# - a# - a# - a# - a# - a# - a# - a# 

RH: c/c#-c/c# - rest - b/c - rest - a#/b - rest - a/a#
LH: a -  a - rest - g# -rest -  g - rest - f#
