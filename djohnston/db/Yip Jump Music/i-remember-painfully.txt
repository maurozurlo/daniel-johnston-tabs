I Remember Painfully:

  C                                                     G
I remember how we looked at the embryo in the jar together
  C                                                     G
And I remember how we stood talking in the store to each other
             C
It was love
                       G
But what is it now
           C F    C F
Its pain

(I feel like it modulates here, but I don't really remember. Keeping the same key, I think it just keeps up the C G F thing)

        C                 G                 F                       C
I remember your face and I remember your grace
     C                     G                        C
I remember, I remember, I just remember
