Almost Got Hit By A Truck

I was walking across the bridge
Going to my friend's house
When I was crossing the road
                             Db
A truck almost ran me down
                                       Db7
Ran me down ran me down oh

B      F#     Ebm
Oh I'm so sad
B         F#                 Ebm
And I know you'll be glad 
            Abm
When I find my way
B                        F#
Find my way oh oh

(verse lick)
I was walking on my way to work
The same day I wasn't looking
And I was in the middle of the street
And a truck almost hit me
Almost hit me almost hit me oh oh

(chorus chords)
Oh I'm not so bad
Please don't be mad
I'm finding my way, 
Finding my way oh oh

(verse lick)
Got to stay along the straight and narrow
Stand off the obstacle course
Or something's liable to happen
Like a truck will run you right over
Run you right down
Run you right over oh oh

(chorus chords)
Oh I'm so glad
And I know that you'll be glad
If I find my way
Find my way oh oh

(verse lick)
Almost got hit by a truck
Almost got hit by a truck
Almost got hit by a truck
Almost got hit by a truck

Abm


This version in G is easier to play on guitar. The lick is the same, just move everything up a fret. (b-c-c#-d-g    f-e)  Use these chord substitutions for the chorus.

C      G     Em
Oh I'm so sad
C         G                   G
And I know you'll be glad 
            Am
When I find my way
C                        G
