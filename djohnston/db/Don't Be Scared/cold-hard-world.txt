Cold Hard World
(thanks to Peter Holy for lyrics and Jimmy Nothin' and Tim L for corrections)

The last chord of the progression is sometimes G, and sometimes G7. Its not really predictable, but the G7 tends to happen during the refrain.

Standard chords work well here. Ive also included a drop-D tuning that allows you to get a similar voicing as the piano chords (the D major in particular)

Drop-D variation. Tune low string down to D.

C   X-3-2-0-1-0
D   0-0-4-2-3-X   or   0-0-4-2-3-2
G   5-5-0-0-0-1 (the thumb is an option for the fifth fret strings)

It's a cold hard world 
It's a cold hard world 
It's a cold hard world 
Oh no

I heard Red Donley say 
It was on the news today 
It's a cold hard world 
It's a cold hard world 
 
It's hiking across the country 
Looking for a bite to eat 
You'd be surprised at the animals 
And the people you'd meet 
 
Rolling down that highway 
With eyes fixed straight ahead 
They have a caravan of cars 
To bury the dead 

 C          D         G(7)       C
| 1 2 3 4 | 1 2 3 4 | 1 2 3 4 | 1 2 3 4 |
 C         D         G(7)
| 1 2 3 4 | 1 2 3 4 | 1 2 3 4 | 1 2 3 4 |


And coke cans and pop bottles 
Lined the streets like flowers instead 
 And this guy gave me a ride 
I said this industrial waste sure stinks 

He said he likes that smell 
'Cause that's the smell of money 
I said "well, mister money stinks, too."
 
It's a cold hard world 
It's a cold hard world 
It's a cold hard world 
Oh no 

I met a fireman 
He said you never forget burning flesh 
And the librarian said 
Do you have a card here? 

I said I been coming here for weeks 
Don't you recognize me by now 
I checked out a million books 
Just to get you to notice me 
 
It's a cold hard world 
It's a cold hard world 
It's a cold hard world 
Oh no 

 C          D         G(7)       C
| 1 2 3 4 | 1 2 3 4 | 1 2 3 4 | 1 2 3 4 |

Somebody's house burned down 
Somebody's hubcap fell off 
Somebody's soul got lost 
Somebody's heart got broke
 
I heard Red Donley say 
It was on the news today 
It's a cold hard world 
It's a cold hard world
