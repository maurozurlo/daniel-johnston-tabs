I Had A Dream
(Thanks to Matthew L for lyrics)

The timing of the A7D7.. section varies from verse to verse but the chords are the same. Ive included several chord options  I know some people have trouble barring (including the man himself!) so there are some easier alternatives. Mix and match

Chord suggestions:

Bbmaj7     X-1-3-2-3-1 (bar 1st)
        6-8-7-7-6-X (either bar at 6th or grab the low string with 
                  thumb)
        X-8-7-7-6-X (a little easier)
        X-X-3-2-3-1 (easier, no barring, but also no bass note)
 
Abmaj7    4-6-5-5-4-X (either bar at the 4th or grab the low string 
                   with thumb)
        X-6-5-5-4-X (a little easier)
        X-X-1-0-1-X (really easy, just make sure you only play 
                   those 3 strings!)

A7      5-7-5-6-5-5 (bar 5th) or X-0-2-0-2-0
D7      X-5-7-5-7-5 (bar 5th) or X-X-0-2-1-2
G7      3-5-3-4-3-3 (bar 3rd) or 3-2-0-0-0-1
C7      X-3-2-3-1-0

I had a dream about you
You were the queen of quite a few
And I was there, but you didnt care
I didnt matter somehow.
 
The band played and you sang a tune
And the stars fell down from the moon
And you smiled a smile that parted the sea
But you didnt notice meno.
Your eyes filled up the sky and they were blue
And you had a weird monkey there with you too
And you danced a jig and tipped his hat
And you turned around with a grin so fat
And he was me.
 
(in the next verse the A7-D7-G7-C7 progression repeats before going to Abmaj7)

There were lights and cameras and fireworks going off in your honor
And I was worried,
But a man said Dont worry, nothing can harm her
And I grabbed the microphone and I stood all alone
And I looked up at you, and you looked down on me
And then you said Off with his head.
 
I had a dream about you
