People see you on the street
And kindly ask you who are you seeing now
You turn so ashamed
Lost without a dame

Everybody says you gotta have a girl
Everybody says you gotta get a girl
And give her your name
Lost without a dame

I been lost since I lost you
Tell me are you feeling the same way too
Or is this just a game
Lost without a dame

Lets hear about the girls in my life
You know my mama she treated me mean
But thats not the same
Lost without a dame
