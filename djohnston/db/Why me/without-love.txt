Intro 

G D

Verse/Chorus

G D C G D

Love
You'll hate it if you have none
And your mommy and your daddy didn't give you none
And you allways on the run
Without Love

Love
You'll regret it if you forgot
And you'll be all tied up in knots
If you can't share and there's no one there

If you don't have love
And all your deepest fears
And sorrows through the years
And there will be no tears
No feelings for anyone

Without love
The mind is completely drained
Saddened by the falling rain
Stuck somewhere in time
And there's nothing there to find

Alone without love
Everyone's gone insane
Everything seems the same
As your life burns life a flame

Without love
You're hiding from each other
Not a word was spoken of it
And your sinking in the mud in the crud

Without love
You'll never know yourself
And there just ain't no help
In hell for the children of the damned

Love
Is the sweetest of refrains
It'll wash away your pain
And you'll be able to understand
It's the greatest power in the land

Love
Will light the way for you
And you'll know just what to do
As you follow through
To a better kind of way

If love could find you some how
You'd be living in the now
And if you thought you loved someone
Then love may come to you

Love
Could be with you all your life
And you just didn't realize
Til you open up your eyes
And see that love was there all along

Love
It never really ends
And love could be your friend
Remember that love is heaven sent
And love is for everyone
