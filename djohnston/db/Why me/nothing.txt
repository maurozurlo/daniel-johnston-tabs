Nothing
from Why Me?

G                                D
Not that you want to be out of curiosity
Em                             C
Just a corsage of the world
G                           Am
I was in love with a girl
C                                  D            D7
I would the violence foresee

(G  D  Em  C  G  Am  C  D  D7 is the same for every verse)

All that it ought to be
Blessed by generosity
Sure do put your heart in a whirl
Stop to pick up a dollar bill
As the blood drips at the mill

Have you got fried chicken?
You ate it up so fast
Layed down his life just for you
Now you have nothing to do
Just a television tube

Though for goodness sake
And the love you make 
Skipping stones at the lake
Youve got a half-baked idea
To think wed be so glad to see ya

Lost in your lonely room
How they grow up and bloom
Young girls in the magazine
How they took part in your doom
Babies step out of the womb

Hunger and lust for life
She was like any housewife
Darning the socks with concern
Glad you ever were born
Just to get up in the morn

Though all the while you were
Surrounded by amateurs
Crazier than love shows insane
Thinking your hope was refrained
And the emotional pain

Nothing to do but cry
As you dry your eyes
Watching the soap opera die
Longing for the freedom of success
When were all just a temporary guest

Living in such a mess
Ill bring you back again
Just like you used to have been
How could really win
Punching your existence to sin

Well drive in the twilight
You think will make it right
Theres nothing left but nothing
But an empty song
Why did it have to go wrong?

How it all works out
Something about it so
Thinking that love is a crime
You were a friend of mine
Standing there at missed time

Youre gonna make it Joe
Love is sure to follow
Happy to be that way
Tomorrow is a brand new day
What do you have to say?
