Try To Love

For C7/Bb bass try this chord X-1-2-0-1-0 or just regular C7

C       G   G7
In my fantasy
You were there with me
I turned towards the mirror
And theres nothing there

I sit in a chair
Washing my underwear
Thinking all along
You were of good cheer

F       G    C    C7/Bb bass
And I am going to try to love
And I am going to rise above

So begins the star
Theres a spark in my heart
But you just stayed away from my memory
I try to get it right
Lay down a song
But theres something wrong with my song

And I am going to try to love
And I am going to rise above

Baby youre the one
Same as any other
And I really tried
But Ive been denied

Crazy as it seems
In the hall of broken dreams
Till theres nothing left
But an empty eggshell

And I am going to try to love
And I am going to rise above

Saw you in my movie
Like you really cared
I turned towards the mirror
And theres nothing there
 
You were on my mind
I tried to unwind
To a better atmosphere of good cheer

And I am going to try to love
And I am going to rise above
I am going to try to love
And I am going to rise above
