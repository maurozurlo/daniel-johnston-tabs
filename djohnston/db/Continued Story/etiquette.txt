The guitar is tuned a bit low on this song (or the tape speed is off) Try a capo on the first fret. The fret numbers for chords are all counted from the capo.

Things that sound cool:
A quick switch to D6 (X-5-7-7-7-7) after the D7 (pinky moves)
A quick switch to G7#9 (3-5-3-4-6-6) after the G7 (more pinky)
Slide up to the A augmented chord.

Try these voicings
C  X-3-2-0-1-0
Ab7 4-6-5-6-4-4
A7  5-7-5-6-8-5
D7  X-5-7-7-7-8
G7  3-5-3-6-3-3
Gaug X-10-9-8-8-X in the bridge use X-10-9-8-8-8
F  1-3-3-2-1-1
Fm  1-3-3-1-1-1
C7  X-3-2-3-1-0

C  Ab7  C  A7  D7  G7  C  Gaug (one chord per bar)

Never noticed her
Why I noticed her so much
I made myself ridiculous

C  Ab7  C  A7  D7  G7  C  D7 (one chord per bar)

Never noticed her 
But I made the blunder 
Of trying to attract her attention instead of giving it 

Bridge:
F  Fm  C  C7  F  Fm  G7  Gaug

When I said hello
I had talked right past her
When she looked at me
I had glanced shyly to one side

C  Ab7  C  A7  D7  G7  C  Gaug (one chord per bar)

I had been so self-conscious,
I acted self-conscious
Notice others and let them notice by directness
Whoo! Play it Bill! Whoo!
Dont be scared; dont be shy.
Youll never know until you try, buddy
Fred is one of the richest people I have ever met
True, he does not have a hoard of money to give away
He cannot pay handsome salaries
He does not entertain lavishly
Or bestow costly gifts
But he overflows with the gold of sincere friendliness
And gets in return a self-satisfaction

country pick this part using regular chord shapes
C  C7  F  F  C  C  G  G
C  C7  F  F  C  G  C  C

An influence, and a power with people 
That all the money in the mint could not buy
He does not wait to see if people will like him
Fred assumes they do like him
That is one of his secrets
He does not wait for them to say hello or smile first
He takes a friendly lead himself and everyone follows
That is another one of the secrets

C  Ab7  C  A7  D7  G7  C  Gaug (one chord per bar)

He does not question whether or not
He will like a person
Or wait before deciding to be friendly

C  Ab7  C  A7  D7  G7  C  C7 (one chord per bar)

He takes it for granted
He will like everyone, every person
This is the third secret of friendliness

Bridge:
F  Fm  C  C7  F  Fm  G7  Gaug

He magnifies others good points
No matter how inconcoicidental
He overlooks a few annoying qualities
Or major bad points

C  Ab7  C  A7  D7  G7  C  Gaug (one chord per bar)

This is the fourth element in contagulous friendliness
Friendliness is very contagious

C  Ab7  C  A7  D7  G7  C (one chord per bar)

The trouble is that many of us wait
To catch it from someone else instead of
Giving the other fella a chance
