She was apart from me
I found another girl for a while
It didnt work out
I was just a loser
Poor loser

A Amaj7/G#  A7/G A/F#  F  G   A
Love, it let me down
Like a nightmare, you werent around
Love, there was none
Probably somewhere else, there was no fun

No one was there
I thought whats the use
Till I found out
Id lost her again
Its a sin

Love, it disappointed me
I thought it was true, it was taken from me
Love, oh cant you see
Someone lied to me, oh how I suffered

If theres any justice
Let it be forever
Some fear that justice
Could be never
But its ever

Love, it kept me going
To make it through my broken life
Love, I had a chance
But it was gone before I knew it

She must have been watching
As I walked all through the town
Looking for love without knowing
As everybody put me down
Like a clown

Love, its around
For any fool who believes
Love, its beautiful
It relieves a saddened heart

I saw her long ago
Pretty flowers in her hair
She worked at the funeral
I wondered if I could get a discount
On a mount

Love, you werent my friend
And I remember you from way back when
Love, you were my shining star
And I havent really gone that far Ive looked at death ?
