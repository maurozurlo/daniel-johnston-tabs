Country Song

G
Well its been a long time since Ive had a drink of alcohol
                                  C
Since the babies grieved and grandma lost her leg
                                G
There aint no sense in dragging the lake anymore
        D                             G
There are bats in the belfry and theres liquor in the store

Well Ive had a look or two at her figure at times
That girl in her tight-wearing bra driving me out of my mind
And there aint no sense remembering nothing for score
Cause my dad fought the Japs in the war and
and then there aint any more

       C
If I was thinking about the Lisa ?
        G
How she tempted me in the basement
D                  G
Recording every noise I made
C                              G
There werent no sense in what they had to say
           D
Cause theyre trying to kill me
                     G
And they say its judgment day

G
When I think of her lips, the way she had em at the store that night
C                          G
The undertaker was waiting in the parking lot
C                                      G
She told me Id be going to find myself in a desperate way
D                     G
It was the best moment of my life

       C
If you think that theyll find you
              G
It really doesnt matter
     C                       G
Ill try my best to save you from the flatter
        C                               D
There aint no sense in crying cause Im gonna win in the end
 G                  C           G
And youll all be sitting around having a good time
