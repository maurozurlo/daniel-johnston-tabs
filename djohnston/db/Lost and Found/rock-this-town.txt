If Ive been there before
And all my dreams are broken
Im a madman at your door
And I cried a million tears
I may never see her again
Im more dead than alive
In her many spacious memories

Gonna rock, gonna rock
Gonna rock this town tonight
Gonna rock, gonna rock
Gonna rock this town tonight

Well I love that marijuana
It makes me feel so high
Tell all your troubles goodbye
Somehow escape the lie of the Hollywood horror

She was so pretty
We were kissing and everything
I had a picture of her
She was a foxy girl so cool
And the macaroni and cheese
Always seemed to please
And every day (Huh) 
As they got down on their knees

Singing rock, gonna rock
Gonna rock this town tonight
Gonna rock, gonna rock
Gonna rock this town tonight

And I love that marijuana
It makes me feel so high
Troubles goodbye
Somehow escape the lie of the Hollywood horror

Were downtown
In the straight and narrow way
And what did we find
A real good time Austin, Texas USA
Let freedom ring
Everybody say
Linda McCartney is dead
Thats what the TV said

Lets rock, were gonna rock
Werre gonna rock this town tonight
Were gonna rock, were gonna rock
Were gonna rock this town tonight

Well I love that marijuana
Makes me feel so high
Tell all your troubles goodbye
Somehow escape the lie of the Hollywood horror

I took my guitar
To the heavy metal school
I told them all about
The golden rule
They just laughed in my face
And called me a space case
The last of the human race
The last of the human race

Lets rock, were gonna rock
Werre gonna rock this town tonight
Were gonna rock, were gonna rock
Were gonna rock this town tonight

And I love that marijuana
Makes me feel so high
Tell all your troubles goodbye
Somehow escape the lie of the Hollywood horror
