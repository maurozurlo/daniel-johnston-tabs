Its impossible
Cant make my mind up
Its impossible
You cant make your mind up
Its impossible
But I wish it were so  ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

Its impossible
How can we get back?
Its impossible
Maybe a time warp
Its impossible
But I wish it were so  ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

C6
Were you mine to hold
To let you disappear
          G6
I just cant allow it
C6
And if I saw you dear
                D7sus4
All my dreams would come true

(chords as before)
But its impossible
The miles between us
Its impossible
Its cold and Im locked up
Its impossible
But I wish it was true  hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo

Its impossible
The years have gone by
Youre impossible
Youre married and you got kids
Its impossible
But I wish it were so  ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho 

You have given me a light so strong
I will carry on
But its no good without you
And if I made a vow
Let me say it now
I love, love, love, love you

But its impossible
Were so really far away
Its impossible
I wouldnt know what to say anyway
Its impossible
But I wish it were so  ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

Its impossible
I guess its impossible
Its impossible
Seems like its impossible
Its impossible
But I wish it were so  ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

I didnt know what to do
With a girl like you
But you made me so happy
And I am still alive
But you are just a jive
How could love be so unreasonable

Its impossible
Cant make my mind
Youre impossible
You cant make your mind up
Its impossible
But I wish it were so  ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho

 Its impossible
How can we get back?
Its impossible
Maybe a time warp
Its impossible
But I wish it was so  ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
