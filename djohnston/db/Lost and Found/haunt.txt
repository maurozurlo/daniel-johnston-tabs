Haunt

C#m     Dm  C       D
Those you love, how they haunt
Bb   C     Dm
Everyones in love

A familiar face to comfort you
What they say and do
Hey girl, can you see me now
Guess I up and died
Remember me like a clear blue sky
Theres no reason why

Gm
And no matter where she goes
C#m         Dm (lick: d-e-f-e-d)
Ill be loving her so

As I pass through this world
Into the great unknown

She was the virgin queen
From a magazine
She played with my imagination
Fascinating my brain
So pretty I just had to stop by
She made the sweetest cherry pie
I caught her once with the look of love
Like a fool I turned aside

And no matter where she goes
Ill be loving her so
As I pass through this world
Into the great unknown

Fills my heart with deep regret
Its not over yet
How she laughed at my stupid jokes
Every time we met
Kind of like the Dating Game
Or the Titanic
It was weird and it was strange
I was so lovesick

And no matter where she goes
Ill be loving her so
As I pass through this world
Into the great unknown

If I reach you from beyond the grave
Maybe you were saved
Just another day for the depraved
No matter what they say
The pregnant lady once said to me
Whats it all about
I said I guess youll never know
And I wished that I could diein my heart

And no matter where she goes
Ill be loving her so
As I pass through this world
Into the great unknown
