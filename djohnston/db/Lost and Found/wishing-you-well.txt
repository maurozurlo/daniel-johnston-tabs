Wishing you well
G            G7
As I spent time in hell

You said youd make sure I was alright
But you jumped on a plane and left me in flight
Seeing you off
Almost knowing youd return

Someone said you had gotten a divorce
I was thinking Id be next in line of course
Hoping youd be mine
Rejection is what I fear

Em
It makes a world of difference
Oh, how I love you
Em
No matter what they say of us
Oh, how I love you
        Dm            G
Because I love you, youre the one
     Dm          G
Who brought me back to life

You said there was a time for us
Somehow that day has always been
Freaked out on love
Reliving old memories

There was a love much stronger than us both
Only we two could know
Wishing you well
As I spend time in hell

Weve been apart for so long
As the hours pass and the years disappear
Eating all the time
Feeding the monster inside

It makes a world of difference
Oh, how I love you
No matter what they say of us
Oh, how I love you
Because I love you, youre the one
That brought me back to life
And I love you, youre my wife
And Ive loved you all my life
And I love, youre my wife
And Ive loved all my life
