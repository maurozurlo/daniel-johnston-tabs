G
fake records of rock and roll

The people go shopping and they lay their money down

Fake records of rock and roll

Fake records of rock and roll, look out

(another instrumental break: see above)

C7                                                                G
Well it used to be youd hear the rock and roll plays
        C7                                                                     D

Cant even get down and boogie
G
Fake records of rock and roll, look out

(back to the instrumental, but only the first part, not the part that goes C, C#, D)
(he always says "look out" here on the last A)

Look out

Look out

Look out

I guess that nowadays they just don't know



I'm not sure about the last chord, but it sounds kind of like a B.
