Time is a matter of fact
           G                  C            G
And its gone and itll never come back
       C                               G     C     G
And mine, its wasted all the time
  D                                     C     C7
Tears stupid tears bring me down

         G           C    G
I got lucky by coincidence
         G        C        G
But I got my feelings bent
           C                           G    C   G
And my head looking at the ground
  D                                   C    C7
Tears stupid tears bring me down

 Am                Em                            G          C   G
How could you know thats where the wind blows
Am           Em                          G            C   G
Out to the wind, thats where my love goes
          G                 C    G
And it brings me down
           C                G    C   G
Tie my brain into a knot
         D                                    C    C7
Those tears stupid tears bring me down

   G              C        G
I know that I have a friend
     G                C        G
He stays with me all day long
     C                              G  C   G
He knows, and I walk in his shell
       D
I was born in the body
And right from the start
          C                  C7
Those tears stupid tears 
                          G   C  G
Been tearing us apart

 Am                Em                            G          C   G
How could you know thats where the wind blows
Am           Em                          G            C   G
Out to the wind, thats where my love goes
          G                 C    G
And it brings me down
           C                G    C   G
Tie my brain into a knot
