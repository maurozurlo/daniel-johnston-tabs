Tell Me Now (Do You Really Love Me)
version from Artistic Vice

The bass plays a C on top of the Am chord. You can play this chord to get that sound: 
X-3-2-2-1-0 or just a regular Am works too.

G      Em
You'll never know dear
  Am      D
The tears that I cried.

(chords keep repeating)
I don't wanna wait, girl, 
Till the day that I die,
Tell me now, oh
Do you really love me?

I don't understand 
The things that you do. 
You promised you'd make me 
The king of the zoo.
Tell me now, oh
Do you really love me?

C                   G
In this world it's hard to find a friend.
How come?
      C                 D
But if this really is love then lets get it on, on, ooo

I wanna know dear 
The way that you feel.
I'm on a roll girl 
My heart's like a wheel.
Tell me now, oh
Do you really love me?

If I can trust 
The look in your eye
But if your kiss 
Could be a lie
Tell me now, oh
Do you really love me?

In this world it's hard to find a friend.
How come?
But if this really is love then lets get it on, on, ooo

Tell me now. 
Do you really love me?
Do you really love me?
Do you really love me?

(Chords: G Em Am D)

When they said that love was dead, 
They were just playing with your head.
Love is real. 
It's the way that I feel.
I love you.
Do you really love me?
Do you really love me?
Do you really love me?
Tell me now

Ending: G C G D G
