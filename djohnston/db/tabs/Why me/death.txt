I wanted to be free
                          C     D       E
But there was nothing left of me
                  D         C          E
I saw the emptiness in her eyes
                            D                     C         E
Though I had to leave, something inside told me
      E        C       A
It hurts to be alone
      E         C     A
It hurts to be alone
          Em        Am       C
You might as well just worry yourself

(all verses and choruses the same as above)

I found that loneliness makes me ill
Till I thought I could reach out to some girl
Like the girlie on TV
Like a magazine that smiles at me
But it hurts to be alone
It hurts to be alone
You might just worry yourself 
to death
death

Way out in the deep blue sea
The fish swim like a family
The big fish eat the little fish
Till the bigger fish eat the bigger fish
And it hurts to be alone
It hurts to be alone
You might just worry yourself 
to death
death

I only wanted to be free
But the world was like a prison to me
When you all alone in the darkness you cant see
Maybe you can get the gist of me
Cause it hurts to be alone
It hurts to be alone
You might just worry yourself 
to death
death

I was wondering what the afterlife was like
Somehow youll get your reward
Pillow for your head, whatever you want
Free refills of your great love soda
Cause it hurts to be alone
It hurts to be alone
You might just worry yourself 
to death
death

Somewhere in the future I might not be there 
I plan to live forever if I dare
I need to happy, I need your affection
I need the kisses Ive been missing
Cause it hurts to be alone
It hurts to be alone
You might just scare yourself 
to death
death
