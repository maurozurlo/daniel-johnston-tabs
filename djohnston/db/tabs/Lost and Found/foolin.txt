Foolin


C      Cm 
I see no reason why
F        Fm
Only that I guess that I 
G          Gm      C (lick: c-b-a-a-b-c-c-b-a-b)
Dont really know what Im doing

A letter that never arrived
Only that I could survive
That I might see whatever is going on

C   F  G   F (4 times)

You took my heart away
Like an act in a play
But I was just another standby
In your soap opera
And now I fear that I
Cant change to compromise
You had me all along
And you were foolin

This love could never doubt
I just wanna sit and pout
Im feeling as if youre leaving me out
Just what am I talking about
Turning away from the cow
As if your golden = led me to a shallow grave

You took my heart away
Like an act in a play
But I was just another standby
In your soap opera
And now I feel that I
Cant change to compromise
You had me all along
And you were foolin

And now I dare to say
It wouldnt happen anyway
Just a love to carry me through back to you
They say that love is blind
But I can see you all the time
Whether or not you think of me in your mind

You took my heart away
Like an act in a play
I was just another standby
In your soap opera
And now I fear that I
Cant change to compromise
You had me all along
And you were foolin

And when I lay me down
To go to sleep
I cant find you anywhere in my dream
And now I venture out
Just another night on the town
It brings me down to feel so happy

You took my heart away
Like an act in a play
I was just another standby
In your soap opera
And now I fear that I
Cant change to compromise
You had me all along
And you were foolin
Foolin, foolin, foolin, foolin
Foolin, foolin, foolin
