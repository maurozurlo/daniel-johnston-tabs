Squiggly Lines

G                            C
If you had seen her youd think it was funny
G                            C
She was so passionate, made everything sunny
G               C
She was dancing all the time
G           C
Never spent a dime
G          C
Always feeling fine
G            C
Always an uphill climb

I thought Id like to get to know her
I thought Id like to get to go with her
But the darkness of the night
Blew out my candlelight
My head was full of fright
What a horrible tragedy plight

And when my ego was shattered
She said it didnt really matter
She said shes got her own boy trained
She said she didnt want one who was not tamed
She said my love was down the drain
And she hated Songs of Pain

I went out to her house foaming at the mouth
She called me a dirty louse
I was crying all the time
See the monkey shine
Talking to myself 
Staring into tears
