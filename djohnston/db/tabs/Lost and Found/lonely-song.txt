Lonely Song

G                    A
Well you heard about the time
  Am7            D
I climbed the Empire State Building
       G          A
And you heard about the time
Am7         D
I was in the insane asylum 

           
    G          C
But I bet you never knew
G           C
What I went through
    G        C
And what I had to do
      D              G
Just to bring you - a lonely song

Instrumental break: G  C  G

Though I try to do whats right
Every day and every night
And when I think Ive won the fight
The monster comes back again

And I bet you never knew
What I went through
And what I had to do
Just to bring you - a lonely song

Instrumental break: G  C  G G7

C
If you listen very hard
You can hear the desperation
                  G
Of a sad and broken heart
    D
My heart

Well you heard about the times
But not all of it is true
And youve read the magazines
Ive been wounded by folklore

But I bet you never knew
What I went through
And what I had to do
Just to bring you - a lonely song

Well Ill tell you right now
Just to set the record straight
I never meant no harm
Or to generate so much hate

Cos I bet you never knew
What I went through
And what I had to do
Just to bring you - a lonely song

G7
