I had a welcome mat
But you never came around
I left my light on
But you were nowhere to be found
I thought an afterthought
Maybe I was forgotten
Never asked me for my name
But I wasnt even in the book

C    
Seems like a love that tried
F
Somehow was on our side
C
We fell in love so deeply
G7
An everlasting kind of love
C
And love was on our side
F
There was no place to hide
C
It seemed to mean so much
G7                 C
An everlasting kind of love

Years ago I was at your door
Asking you for directions
You said you loved another
And I wasnt even mentioned
As I play piano
I get this eerie feeling
You were never really there
I guess I must be dreaming

Seems how I really tried
But our love was denied
Somehow it was a lie
An everlasting kind of love
Then you took me for a ride
I was so hurt inside
You smiled and then you cried
An everlasting kind of love

Mom and dad said I sure was lost
Just all the time make-believing
Just what is the difference
In my heart Im always there
How can you in the art room
You said you had to go-oh
I took it out on a shopping cart
Screaming in my mind It isnt so

Guess thats the way it goes
You seem to love, I suppose
But I was at the end of my rope
An everlasting kind of love
I cant tell you how I love
The shining stars above
With no ill thoughts about you
An everlasting kind of love

I took a walk, I was so in love
But I had nowhere to go
Everywhere I looked, I swear
I saw you in every window
Till I died inside
From being all alone
Your love carried me on
I just kept on dreaming of your love

Seems like a love that tried
Somehow was on our side
What could we have done to save
An everlasting kind of love
And love was on our side
It seemed to mean so much
Could couldnt lost touch
An everlasting kind of love

Seems like a love that tried
Somehow was on our side
We fell in love so deeply
An everlasting kind of love
Seems like a love that tried
Somehow was on our side
What could we have done to save
An everlasting kind of love
