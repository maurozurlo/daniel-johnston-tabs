Casper The Friendly Ghost

     C
He was smiling through his own personal hell
F
Dropped his last dime down a wishing well
       C
But he was hoping too close
And then he fell
      G         
Now hes Casper the friendly ghost
     C
He was always polite to the people whod tell him
   F
That he was nothing but a lazy bum
  C
But goodbye to them he had to go
     G
Now hes Casper the friendly ghost


(Keyboard break notes: c-e-g-c, f-a-c-f, c-e-g-c, g-b-d-g
          chords: C     F    C     G


    C 
Nobody treated him nice
While he was alive
      F 
You cant buy no respect
Like the librarian said but
C
Everybody respects the dead
   G          C
They love the friendly ghost

(keyboard break)
 
               C 
And now they say well never forget
What he learned us
       F
We were mean to him
But he never burned us and
C
Love lives forever 
       G          C
Thank you Casper the Friendly Ghost
       G          C
Thank you Casper the Friendly Ghost

(keyboard break is the same on the first repetition, but the G chord melody changes to g-f-e-d for the rest of the song)
