When I was out in San Marcos a year ago today
        G                                         D
They probably would have put me in a home
       G                                    C
But I threw out all my belongings into a garbage bag
     G                   D                G
And out into the world-ness I did roam
     C                                 G
My hopes lay shattered like a mirror on the floor
   C                                 D
I see myself and I look really   scattered
    G   C                   G      D
But I live my broken dream

The wildest summer that I ever knew
I had a flat tire down memory lane
But I came back after five months and a half
And now I m just trying to explain
And now I m here and here I stand
With a sweet angel holding my hand
I live my broken dream
