What Ive Seen

I only hear the top 4 strings being strummed on this tune.  The ooooh part is just a D chord moving down one fret at a time starting from the 5th fret.

D   X-X-0-2-3-2
G   X-X-0-0-0-3
G7   X-X-0-0-0-1
F/D   X-X-0-5-6-5
E/D   X-X-0-4-5-4
Eb/D   X-X-0-3-4-3

What Ive Seen

Opening: pick through this progression:  D    D    G    G7 
using this string pattern: 1st - 2nd - 3rd - 2nd 


D
The birds that fly 
Way up high in the sky
                    G      G7
They know why 
                       D
And what I mean
My minds captive I cant forget you
               G     G7
I cant forget 
what Ive seen

F/D                         E/D
Oooooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh
Eb/D                       D
Oooooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh
(repeat)

      D
Im on the run like a bullet from a gun
                 G            G7         
I cant remember 
                  D
where Im from
Ive become this dumb
Because I had to make myself numb
                 G         G7
If I ever wanted 
to get anything done

F/D                         E/D
Oooooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh
Eb/D                       D
Oooooh, ooh, ooh, oooooh
(repeat)
