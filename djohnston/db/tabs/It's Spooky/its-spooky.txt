Sometimes when Im watching television
And I think that most of the people in the movie
Are probably dead
And its spooky

And when I go to a funeral
See the people weeping
And the body in the casket
Its spooky

And in the Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoon
I always wondered how it was
That he died
And its spooky
Its spooky
Ooooo 
Somethings happening in the world
