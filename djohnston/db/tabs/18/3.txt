When I was born in 61
They already had a hit
And they worked so ha-a-ard
And they made it Joe
But they really were very good
They deserve all their success
And they earned it, yes they did
They didnt buy their respect
And everybody wanted to be like them
Everybody wanted to be the Beatles
And I really wanted to be like him
But he died
The legendary rock group
Its history now to read
Like a magical fairy tale 
Thats hard to believe
But it really did happen
Four lads that shook the world
God bless them for what they done
