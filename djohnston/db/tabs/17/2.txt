For sorrow pancakes so flat

1   2   3  4  | 1   2   3  4   |
Keep it light forever   
Not realizing my own fate     
It s great   the weight upon me now 

(same as opening)
      
Nothing for me nowhere  
But the emptiness I feel      
Depression has got me down    
Drilling for the kill   
      
It s too late to suffer through     
God, I ll make you a deal:    
Just let me smile a while   for real.     


C                                    F                   G

(repeat)
         
And when the evening comes    
I ll be on the run      
You were the only one   
That sure was fun

1  2  3  4  | 1  2  3  4 | 1  2  3  4 | 1  2  3  4 |    
To me it s never been any better    
And no kind of love has been any greater  
Than you, for me, I can tell  

F              G                F             G               C            C7

You shone like a sacred goddess in love   
Like a psycho hot as the sun  


(chords here are the same as  And when the evening comes )
Until we meet again, I won t give up      
 It s such a wonder for us   our inner quest     

 (chords here are the same as  To me it s never been any better  )
And so it starts  
The alligator when you appeared     
From never forever      
And you smiled on my poor suffering soul  
Blessed child, you are my treasure  
Can t you see, it s all an illusion 
I love you more than myself   

C                     C7
1   2    3    4  |   1   2   3   4  |   (repeat 4 times)   
I love you more than myself   
I love you more than myself   
I love you more than myself   
I love you more than myself   

(same chords as opening)      
And I wish to see you again   
And I wish to see you again   
And I wish to see you again   
And I wish to see you again   
And I wish to see you again
