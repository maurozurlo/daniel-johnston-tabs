Now

The first  lo-fi  part is played using fingerings for G, C, and D, but either he s using a capo on the second fret, or the tape is running fast, or he s just got the guitar tuned a step up.  Whatever the reason, the resulting chords sound A, D, and E

The second  studio  section is in actual G major.

Em9    0-2-2-0-0-2 work nicely at the end.

If you think your thoughts so rationally
Then you might just see it s not so funny

Prey tell.
The wishing well will get you eventually.
Beware.
What you are is what you re doing there.

(First progression)
 Love is lingering with you on it s mind
And it s giving you a moment so kind

(Second Progression) 
Believe.
Your broken heart could heal so dramatically
And with a little luck
You could see a better way again real soon

(First progression)
 As we stare into each other s eyes
And each year just goes so fast and goodbye

(Second Progression)  
Look around
What your friends are telling you so free
Be gone
It s all over as the sun does set once more

(First progression) 
If you think that love has a chance with you
Maybe hope can shine a light so true

(Second Progression) 
 Just smile  
You can win the victory so sweet    
And know    
It s just another day for you and me

repeat
And tomorrow   no more sorrow 
You can all her - if you want to    
There s a new way   why won t you try it  
Heaven sent it and you ll believe it

Love can save you now   
Love can save you now   
Love can save you now
