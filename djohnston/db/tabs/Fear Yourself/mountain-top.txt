Mountain Top

Some question as to whether it's Am or A7 in the verse.  I definitely hear Am in the chorus.

G                 C
On top of a mountain top
  Am                              D
I stood and thought one day
G                    C
I could really see a lot
       Am             D
And if I had my way

D                     Am
A lazy young sod I was
C                                G    G/F# bass)
So deep in love those days
D                            Am
And if there was nothing was
     C                  G  G/F# bass
But only love I crave
