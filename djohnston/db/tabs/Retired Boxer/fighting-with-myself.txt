As always... the recording speed is off.  Daniel played it in C, but the recording is  in C#.  I'm posting chords in C.

I had a couple of places where I wasn't sure about lyrics - I put them in brackets.   Please post any corrections...

Fighting With Myself

C                    G7
I was shadow boxing
C                                    E
And my shadow punched back
A                 Dm
Can you imagine
B       Em       Dm  G7
My surprise

C                    G7
Then I got to thinking
C                                         E
If theres something I dont know
A                           Dm
Something inside of me
B                         Em     Dm   G7
That Im trying to hide

C                      G7
Fighting with myself
                   C
I may never win
                      G7
But Ill never stop
                     E
When did I begin?
                F              C            G7
Till I can rest [these feet]

Verse chords:  C     G7     C     E     A     Dm     B     Em     Dm G7
I looked in the mirror
And I wasnt there
[Then I was] I wondering where
I could be now

So I sat in a chair
And tried to relax
But I really
Dont know how

Chorus chords:  C    G7    C    G7    E    F    C   G7
Fighting with myself
I may never win
But Ill never stop
When did I begin?
Till I can rest [these feet]

Verse chords:  C     G7     C     E     A     Dm     B     Em     Dm G7
Sometimes I feel
Like I could get along
But it always ends
In tears

Sometimes I feel
Like I could be happy
But I always find
Something to fear
