Wild West Virginia

The little melody on the F chord is f-e-d-e with the last e landing on the C chord
I'm not sure abot the "Get the shivering" lyric...

        G
Im going back to the place 
                  F  C
That I used to call home
        G
Im going back to the place 
                       F  C
Where the antelope never roam

Bb       F
Wild West Virginia
C         G
Home of the nave
    Bb         F
This boy be mighty pleased 
              G
To see them rolling hills
F     G
Rolling hills

No I dont like John Denver 
But I always will remember those rolling hills
You got a backwoods woman
Underprivileged mama, farmer in the dell
Crooked politicians
Crater bum roads
But oh I love it so
Those rolling hills (Wild West Virginia)
Rolling hills (Wild West Virginia)

Get the shivering bout how the river
In the cold winter
When a snowflake falls on your face
You feel just like an iceberg
But I wouldnt trade it
For the sticky hot weather in Texas
Im gonna make an exodus
To them rolling hills (Wild West Virginia)
Rolling hills (Wild West Virginia)

I get this wheeling feeling
Singing like Slim Whitman 
Oh how I wanna go home
Away from them big city slickers
Skinny intellectuals and them tall buildings
Back to wild West Virginia
Home of the nave
This boy be mighty pleased
To see them rolling hills (Wild West Virginia)
Rolling hills

Bb      F
God is an artist 
      C           G
And he painted a pretty picture
      Bb         F
And he called it West Virginia
           G
With the rolling hills
F     G
Rolling hills
F     G (etc.)
Rolling hills
(Wild West Virginia)
(Wild West Virginia)
