G                     C
I've come this far and I know I can make it
G                      D (usually C in live recordings)
I've got a broken heart and you can't break a broken heart
     D          C
I come knocking at your door
      G      D
You don't love me anymore
    D        C 
But I just can't give up
     G           D
'Cause I don't know what to do about it

G                          C
You must be wrong if you think you don't love me
G                          C
You could smile down on and put an happy ending to my song
     D        C
I come knocking at your door
      G        D
You don't live there anymore
   D    C   
Is it just a memory
   G      D
Or am I a little crazy for you


G                   C
If there's no love I just can't believe it
G                    C  
I've got a broken mind and only you can relieve it
      C         D
I don't remember who you are
     G         D
Are you someone that I saw
     D      C 
'Cause I really am confused
     G     D    
But I think that I still love you
