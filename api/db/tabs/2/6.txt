It's a cold hard world 
It's a cold hard world 
It's a cold hard world 
Oh no

I heard Red Donley say 
It was on the news today 
It's a cold hard world 
It's a cold hard world 
 
It's hiking across the country 
Looking for a bite to eat 
You'd be surprised at the animals 
And the people you'd meet 
 
Rolling down that highway 
With eyes fixed straight ahead 
They have a caravan of cars 
To bury the dead

And coke cans and pop bottles 
Lined the streets like flowers instead 
 And this guy gave me a ride 
I said this industrial waste sure stinks 

He said he likes that smell 
'Cause that's the smell of money 
I said "well, mister money stinks, too."
 
It's a cold hard world 
It's a cold hard world 
It's a cold hard world 
Oh no 

I met a fireman 
He said you never forget burning flesh 
And the librarian said 
Do you have a card here? 

I said I been coming here for weeks 
Don't you recognize me by now 
I checked out a million books 
Just to get you to notice me 
 
It's a cold hard world 
It's a cold hard world 
It's a cold hard world 
Oh no

Somebody's house burned down 
Somebody's hubcap fell off 
Somebody's soul got lost 
Somebody's heart got broke
 
I heard Red Donley say 
It was on the news today 
It's a cold hard world 
It's a cold hard world
