Key: C
Easiest version

C      X-3-2-0-1-0
C6     X-3-2-2-1-0
Cmaj7   X-3-2-0-0-0
F      X-X-3-2-1-X or X-X-3-2-1-1
F6     X-X-3-2-3-X or X-X-3-2-3-1
Fmaj7   X-X-3-2-1-0
G      3-2-0-0-0-3


A little harder

All chords the same except:

Cmaj7   X-3-2-4-0-0
Fmaj7   X-X-3-5-5-0

On the G chord try alternating these chords on eighth notes (every strum) to mimic the piano part. Use the thumb to fret the low note and mute the fifth string.
G      3-X-0-0-3-3
Gsus4   3-X-0-0-1-3

Really full sounding alternate tuning version

Tune sixth string down to C
Tune fifth string down to F
Tuning: C-F-D-G-B-E
All strings strummed all the time (almost)!

C      0-2-2-0-1-0
C6     0-2-2-2-1-0
Cmaj7   0-2-2-4-0-0
F      0-0-3-2-1-1 or 0-0-3-2-1-X
F6     0-0-3-2-3-1 or 0-0-3-2-3-X
Fmaj7   0-0-3-2-1-0 or 0-0-3-5-5-0
G      2-2-0-0-3-3 (you may want to thumb the bottom two 
                   strings on these)
Gsus4   2-2-0-0-1-3

Lastly! The one that sounds most like the actual piano part

Use the same tuning in the previous one. All chords are the same except:

C     0-7-5-5-8-X (bar at 5th on all of these)
C6    0-7-5-5-5-5
Cmaj7  0-7-5-5-5-7

Blue clouds twisted into a tunnel 
somewhere far off the thunder roaring 
and the fortune teller has fixed her sleepy eyes on my child
 
Sometimes I climb high up a tree 
to let the wind blow in my face 
sometimes I leave my cares lying in piles

REFRAIN:
Somewhat disturbing is the sound of birds singing 
when you know you don't deserve it 
You are not here today 
and I feel just like an empty eggshell, and
My yoke is heavy

It's new to me 
But just the same 
the earth is an old canvas 
painted over many times 

The poet rambles 
The world it scrambles 
But who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men 

Your shadow knows 
It's right behind you all the way 
Your shadow knows where you've been 

Refrain chords

Of the dark deep gloom 
That took up so much room 
In my many spacious memories

And many are the times 
I thought and rethought 
The thoughts you got me thinking 
Though the sun shines bright upon me now 
And I am young and kicking 
My yoke is heavy 
My yoke is heavy
