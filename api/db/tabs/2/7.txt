I had a dream about you
You were the queen of quite a few
And I was there, but you didnt care
I didnt matter somehow.
 
The band played and you sang a tune
And the stars fell down from the moon
And you smiled a smile that parted the sea
But you didnt notice meno.
Your eyes filled up the sky and they were blue
And you had a weird monkey there with you too
And you danced a jig and tipped his hat
And you turned around with a grin so fat
And he was me.
 
(in the next verse the A7-D7-G7-C7 progression repeats before going to Abmaj7)

There were lights and cameras and fireworks going off in your honor
And I was worried,
But a man said Dont worry, nothing can harm her
And I grabbed the microphone and I stood all alone
And I looked up at you, and you looked down on me
And then you said Off with his head.
 
I had a dream about you
