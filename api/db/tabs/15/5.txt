The picture drawing
The pretend heroes
My favorite was Captain America
The little girl
The flowers in the yard
The dog and cat
The welcome mat

God told me to go out
Singing my songs and whatnot
Led me to the holy river bap-i-tism
Holy, holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy, holy

It must have been
It must have been
It must have been a happy time, time
(repeat)

The GI Joes
The plastic monsters
My dads model airplanes
Life magazines
The bible stories
Kimba the lion
The King Kong

I was a cosmic child
Walking the second mile
I had to defeat the aliens
Bloody battle
Fight to the finish
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight

It must have been
It must have been
It must have been a happy time, time
It must have been
It must have been
It must have been a happy time, time, time, time, time
