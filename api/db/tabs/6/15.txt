Key: C

Daniel usually throws in bass note runs connecting the chords in the verses:

Bass:
C C D D#        E E D C         A       D Db
Treble
C               E7              Am      D7

C                 E7
Once upon a stage 
Am                   D7
An evening of praise 
C                                  E7
the public has come to see 
Am               D7
the saddest singer 

C     F    C     F

C   E7  Am  D7
progression
And he's playing, playing the song 
and it's a classic 
and his fingers, fingers are bleeding 
and his heart is aching out loud 

C                                                 F                                   C           F
And the people are clapping and clapping and clapping and clapping 
            C                               F                            C          F
and the song he is playing just goes on and on and on 
Continue
C    F   C    F
and it seems like it will never stop 
then everybody gets up and does a hop - yeah 

C      F7     C     F7  (solo around notes C-Eb-F)

C   E7   Am   D7
Then the entertainer 
chained to the piano 
gives a nervous grin 
to the massive crowd 

             C                            F               C                 F
He says here's one about the day I really broke my heart 
C   F   C   F
and he sheds a tear, the audience applauds 
everyone shouting - he's so sincere 
I can't believe he's here 

C                           E7
Then he does his famous 
Bass:
A             D            D C B A
Am            D7
song of sorrow 
               C           F       C      F
and his melody of pain 
             D         Daug
and he bows 
               G              Gaug
and the curtain falls 

                C             E7
And the white in his eyes 
                     Am               D
is reflecting light from the ceiling 
           C        E7
as he prays alone 
               Am              D
a silent prayer to his lover 
                 C
whom he lost 
                E7
whom he sings about 
                Am                      D
whom he thinks about all the time 
       Am               E
he sits for a little bit 
         Am                           D    Daug       G
and then he writes another hit  -  ohhhh     

C    F7    C     F7
(solo to end)
