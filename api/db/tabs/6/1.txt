I'm the phantom of my own opera
F       D7
Oh don't I know it
    C       G      C   G  
And I think of you, sweetheart

I'm lurking in the shadows
of my memory
We were going to have a circus in the bar

But the creature lurks among us
The ghost of our past 
The gho-o-ost of our love

And if I had my own way
 C
I always say that phrase
 F            C
I thought it was a phase
      G
But it wasn't

(verse chords)
And so here I am
In my baggy clown costume
Perform any funny trick and throw a kiss
to the audience

And I'm wearing a mask
But you don't have to ask
Who I'm thinking about

And there's a monkey in the background
Hung by a rope from the ceiling
And I'm the villain, acting fierce
And stretching whiskers toothsomely

(bridge chords)
The phantom wears a black coat
Long trousers and a derby
Stands erect and cracks the whip loudly

(verse chords)
I'm the phantom of my own opera
I perform all the parts
And I think of you, sweetheart

I'm even the audience
And I can't help thinking
We were going to have a circus in the bar

Can't pull the curtain
I can't help remembering
Turn a somersault after singing a verse

And the song is never ending 
And I never quit rehearsing
A performance of a sad and twisted heart

(bridge chords)
And if I had my own way
I don't know what I'd do
Id probably wish it was you
