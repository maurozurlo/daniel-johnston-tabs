Where the wind blows

Where the moon is
That's where I am
And when I just
Have a problem
Always hoping the wind will blow me away again

I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainer
I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainer

Drove those demons
Out of my head
With an organ and a pencil full of lead
And when I'm dead
I'd like to have it said
He drove those demons out of his head

I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainer
I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainer

Now the curtain parts the stage
It's the dawn of a new and exciting age
And I'm free
Free at last
Like a monkey out of its cage

I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainer
I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainer

Another version:
I just banged it out on the piano - these piano chords replicate the guitar part pretty well.

Try playing a single note melody with the left hand:
Left Hand
Verse: 
E E F# E G E G# A 

With the right hand play two-note half-step clusters. i.e G/G# means play G and G# at the same time.

Right Hand
Verse: 
G/G# G/G# A/A# G/G# A#/B G/G# B/C C/C#

If you play these left and right hand parts together, it sounds pretty cool... 

For the chorus try these left hand and right hand parts together

RH: 
C/C# C/C# B/C B/C
LH: 
A A  E  E G# G#  E  E

(repeat 6 times) then...

RH: 
C#/D C#/D C#/D C#/D C#/D C#/D C#/D C#/D 
LH: 
A# A# A# A# A# A# A# A# 

RH: 
C/C# C/C# B/C A#/B A/A#
LH: 
A A G# G F#
