G
True love will find you in the end
c            G
Youll find out just who was your friend
Em         Am
Dont be sad, I know you will,
C
But dont give up until
C         G
True love finds you in the end.

This is a promise with a catch
Only if youre looking will it find you
cause true love is searching too
But how can it recognise you
Unless you step out into the light?
But dont give up until
True love finds you in the end.
