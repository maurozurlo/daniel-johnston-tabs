Key: Am
Am                                      Am  G  F
I don't have to say a thing
F                                                F  E  Dm
she knows exactly what I want
Dm           
and anytime I feel like this
               Em                               E  G  Am
what we have goes out for lunch
Am                                                  Am G  F
she looks at me like a gun cocked
F                                               F  E  Dm
and I'm afraid to turn my back
       Em                 Am
for fear of being locked

         Em
she leans forward for me to see
              Am
that the lights of her majesty
           Em
she's tempting me with a razorblade
      Am   
but time is money at a penny arcade
                    Em                    F
and there's monkeys in the shadows
                   Em                                   F
and the birds that are afraid of being late
           Em                          F
the court jester holds up a light bulb and says
                                            Am
all that is made is made to decay

      C                    F 
to know her is to love her
             G                      C             C/B
and I love her, but I don't know her
     C                     F
to know her is to love her
         G                            C            C/B
and I love her, but I don't know her
 
Verse chords Am    Am G F        F   E   Dm    Em   E  G  Am
I feel for a place to sit
things always go on this way
I'm lost for a little bit
'til I come up with something to say
then I'll go on and on
about rat skulls in her lawn
I'm not specifically gonna mention names
her and I know were just a shame

Em
she knows I'm here
             Am
and she readily rebukes her sister
           Em
she treats me with a sudden respect
Am
suddenly she calls me mister
        Em       F         Em     F
but just as soon, I soon forget
              Em               F             Em      F
and start poking around in the trash
 Em              F         Em       F
talking myself into outer space
      Em                                          Am
and watching the reactions on her face
 

Chorus chords: 
C    F    G   C   C/B

to know her is to love her
and I love her, but I don't know her
to know her is to love her
and I love her, but I don't know her
 
Verse chords
Am    Am G F        F   E   Dm    Em   E  G  Am

the picture of her sitting there
being her on that chair
I can only say as much as I please
but not as much as I dare
where is the little girl who fell in love with me
the girl who fell in love with a satellite
that little girl has moved out now
but the satellite still comes around
most every other night

Verse chords Am    Am G F        F   E   Dm    Em   E  G  Am

I think my interest bleeds a heart
of a dead dog
lying in her yard
I could catch her standing naked
I could catch her cold
I could catch her breath and bottle it
but I could never catch her off guard

      Em
and I go there nowadays
              Am
it's like visiting a sinking ship
  Em
and I'm a man overboard
                   Am                            Em  F 
and she won't throw me a lifeline
Em               F               Em            Am
symbolically represented by her lips
 

Chorus chords:  C    F    G   C   C/B

yes, to know her is to love her
and I love her, but I don't know her
to know her is to love her
and I love her, but I don't know her
            Am
no no no no
