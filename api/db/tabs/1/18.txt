Premarital sex


At the place that I work
The guys are always talking
About sexual delights
And pleasures of the flesh
You can get it plenty
You can get it nice
You can get it anywhere at anytime
If you pay the price

First you say that you will
But you know you won t
But you gotta get your thrill
Don t look at me
Go ahead and take the pill
Premarital sex
