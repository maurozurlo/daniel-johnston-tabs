G     D   C  G
When I was a little kid
   Em   Am   C  D   G
And all the people they looked big 
 G   D     C   G
I never exactly understood
 Em        Am  C  D  G
How to tell the trees from the wood
 
 D       C  G    Em Am  C D G

D         C   G
Joy without pleasure 
    Em      Am C D G
Ain't no fun, ain't no fun at all
Joy without pleasure 
Ain't no fun, ain't no fun at all
 
My mama she took me aside one day 
She said you better have fun while you play
'Cause someday you'll wake up and you'll be old
And all of your youth will be gone away
And you work in a factory and you earn your pay
And your fingers will rot and your mind will decay
You'll be happy, so happy with your family and house
But you'll never, you'll never enjoy yourself 
 
Joy without pleasure 
Ain't no fun, ain't no fun at all
Joy without Pleasure 
Ain't no fun, ain't no fun at all
 
The Son of Charles Dickens and a little red hen
Danced the watusi like it was a sin
They tried to enjoy it but they feel so guilty
Guilt won't allow you to enjoy a stolen apple
 
Joy without pleasure 
Ain't no fun, ain't no fun
Joy without pleasure 
Ain't no fun
Joy without pleasure 
Ain't no fun
(last chord is G7)
