Key: G

Intro (and after every chorus):  G    Em

G                   Em
When Im down, really down
C                      D          D7
Nothing matters, nothing does
G                     Em
I close my eyes and go to sleep
C                    D              D7
But I cant sleep, I cant sleep

G                   C          G
Please hear my cry for help 
                    D          G
And save me from myself

Junior high, I lost my mind
I dont know why, its a terrible thing
Since that day its been a struggle
Trying to make sense out of scrambled eggs

Please hear my cry for help 
And save me from myself

I painted a bar and I never got paid
In a town where everyone was unemployed
I was locked in on Easter Day
All I had to eat was a piece of bread
When I got home my mother said,
Youre a lazy bum and thats how come
You suffer like that, and youll starve
All your life, all your life
Spoken just like it was a curse
But it didnt really sound so bad
I like to make things up
Its the healthiest thing that I do
But Im tired from being kidnapped
By a dark wolf that would do me in

Please hear my cry for help 
And save me from myself

C            D                G
Im just saying how I feel
C          D           G          C
Maybe you could try to understand
         G             C      G
Im a man who needs you

(G   Emin  like intro)

When Im down, really down
Nothing matters, nothing does
I close my eyes and go to sleep
But I cant sleep, I cant sleep
You can listen to these songs
Have a good time and walk away
But for me its not that easy
I have to live these songs forever

Please hear my cry for help 
And save me from myself
